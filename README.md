### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup

### What I learned

With this challenge I've learned a lot of concept on animation. I've learned a concept called reflow that restart your animation but can cost performance. I also learned a lot on 3d css animation.


### Continued development

On I'll continue to create accessible UI and actually testing it with screen readers and deep deeper on css animation.
